    We provide concentrated doses of programming experience across a wide range
    of topics.

  %p
    Our lessons are developed by #{link_to "Gregory Brown", "https://twitter.com/practicingruby"}, 
    with the help of many contributors. Even though this project is called Practicing Ruby, 
    most of our articles tend to focus on exploring the field of software development
    in general rather than fixating entirely on language-specific details.

  %p
    Practicing Ruby's

    = link_to "Open Source", open_source_path
    page for all our code and manuscripts, including the
    Rails application that runs this website.
