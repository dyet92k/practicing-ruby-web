    Our lessons are developed by #{link_to "Gregory Brown", "https://twitter.com/practicingruby"}, 
    with the help of many contributors. Even though this project is called Practicing Ruby, 
    most of our articles tend to focus on exploring the field of software development
    in general rather than fixating entirely on language-specific details.
